# Donders-Institute-Data

This organization holds datalad versions of some of the datasets published in the [Donders Repository](https://data.donders.ru.nl). Using [datalad](https://www.datalad.org) you can `clone` these datasets and you can `get` the files on request. Only the README, LICENSE and MANIFEST files are actually stored, all other files will be downloaded automatically upon request. 

Alternatively, you can access public datasets using webdav via <https://public.data.donders.ru.nl>.

You can also access restricted access datasets via <https://webdav.data.donders.ru.nl>, this require registering, logging in and agreeing to the collection-specific Data Use Agreement (DUA). See [here](https://data.donders.ru.nl/doc/help/faq/access-shared-data.html) for instructions.
